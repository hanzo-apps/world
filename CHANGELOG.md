# Changelog

All notable changes to World Monitor are documented here.

## [2.4.4]

### Changed

- **Cloud Pulse is real when a service token is wired**: `/v1/world/cloud-pulse` now folds MEASURED platform-wide 24h request/token volume from the ClickHouse-backed usage ledger (`get-cloud-usages ?org=all`, super-admin) on top of the live model/node/GPU/region counts — dropping both `demo:true` and `volumeModeled:true`. Top models come from real ledger spend. Without a token, or with a non-admin token, it stays honestly demo/modeled — platform numbers are never faked silently. The service bearer stays server-side (never sent to the browser).

## [2.4.2]

### Added

- **Streaming analyst**: answers flow in live over SSE — reasoning shows as dim thinking text, tool calls appear as chips the moment they run, the reply types itself in; the final render and command dispatch are unchanged (done event = the old JSON contract)
- **Model menu**: the composer pill opens a grouped popover (Auto / Zen / GPT / Llama / Claude / Agents) with per-family marks and an active check

### Fixed

- **Model identity**: the Zen ring appears only on zen* models — gpt-oss/llama/claude get their own marks on the pill, menu rows, avatars, and the thinking row
- **Dev server**: `npm run dev` proxies /v1 to production by default (VITE_DEV_API_PROXY overrides)

## [2.4.1]

### Added

- **Western Pacific cyclones**: cross-agency tropical-cyclone attribution (GDACS + HKO warnings via new `/v1/world/hko-warnings` proxy) with per-agency wind observations, canonical dedup, and map popup detail rows
- **China macro snapshot**: `/v1/world/china-macro` — CPI/CLI (OECD), policy rate, USD/CNY (FRED), HKMA context, NBS release calendar + PBoC LPR dates, surfaced with staleness-honest indicator tiles
- **Model roster**: `Best (auto)` leads the analyst model picker — the gateway routing alias that always resolves

### Changed

- **AI default model**: `zen5` → `best`; a pinned family id goes dark when the inference plane's claim catalog shifts, the routing alias never does
- **Server cache is now stale-while-revalidate**: `cachedJSON`/`passthrough` serve stale instantly and refresh in the background (single-flight); GDELT/theater-posture no longer stall requests ~10s on TTL expiry
- **GDELT cache warmers**: hot keys (analyst grounding, protests layer) refreshed every ~4min so no user ever eats a cold miss
- **Sparkline payloads**: close arrays rounded to 7 significant digits (float32-widening noise stripped, ~40% smaller; scalars untouched)

### Fixed

- **News first paint**: panels no longer gate their first DOM write on a 65MB ML sentiment model download — headlines paint immediately, sentiment refines in place
- **Analyst grounding snapshot**: context fetches bounded at 2.5s so a cold endpoint can't hold the chat send hostage
- **AI errors are honest**: upstream error codes (`insufficient_balance`, `spend_cap_exceeded`, …) surface in the chat instead of a bare `status 402`

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Live Webcams Panel**: 2x2 grid of live YouTube webcam feeds from global hotspots with region filters (Middle East, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Americas), grid/single view toggle, idle detection, and full i18n support (#111)
- **Linux download**: added `.AppImage` option to download banner

### Changed

- **Mobile detection**: use viewport width only for mobile detection; touch-capable notebooks (e.g. ROG Flow X13) now get desktop layout (#113)
- **Webcam feeds**: curated Tel Aviv, Mecca, LA, Miami; replaced dead Tokyo feed; diverse ALL grid with Jerusalem, Tehran, Kyiv, Washington

### Fixed

- **Le Monde RSS**: English feed URL updated (`/en/rss/full.xml` → `/en/rss/une.xml`) to fix 404
- **Workbox precache**: added `html` to `globPatterns` so `navigateFallback` works for offline PWA
- **Panel ordering**: one-time migration ensures Live Webcams follows Live News for existing users
- **Mobile popups**: improved sheet/touch/controls layout (#109)
- **Intelligence alerts**: disabled on mobile to reduce noise (#110)
- **RSS proxy**: added 8 missing domains to allowlist
- **HTML tags**: repaired malformed tags in panel template literals
- **ML worker**: wrapped `unloadModel()` in try/catch to prevent unhandled timeout rejections
- **YouTube player**: optional chaining on `playVideo?.()` / `pauseVideo?.()` for initialization race
- **Panel drag**: guarded `.closest()` on non-Element event targets
- **Beta mode**: resolved race condition and timeout failures
- **Sentry noise**: added filters for Firefox `too much recursion`, maplibre `_layers`/`id`/`type` null crashes

## [2.3.9] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Full internationalization (14 locales)**: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Russian, Arabic, Chinese Simplified, Japanese — each with 1100+ translated keys
- **RTL support**: Arabic locale with `dir="rtl"`, dedicated RTL CSS overrides, regional language code normalization (e.g. `ar-SA` correctly triggers RTL)
- **Language switcher**: in-app locale picker with flag icons, persists to localStorage
- **i18n infrastructure**: i18next with browser language detection and English fallback
- **Community discussion widget**: floating pill linking to GitHub Discussions with delayed appearance and permanent dismiss
- **Linux AppImage**: added `ubuntu-22.04` to CI build matrix with webkit2gtk/appindicator dependencies
- **NHK World and Nikkei Asia**: added RSS feeds for Japan news coverage
- **Intelligence Findings badge toggle**: option to disable the findings badge in the UI

### Changed

- **Zero hardcoded English**: all UI text routed through `t()` — panels, modals, tooltips, popups, map legends, alert templates, signal descriptions
- **Trending proper-noun detection**: improved mid-sentence capitalization heuristic with all-caps fallback when ML classifier is unavailable
- **Stopword suppression**: added missing English stopwords to trending keyword filter

### Fixed

- **Dead UTC clock**: removed `#timeDisplay` element that permanently displayed `--:--:-- UTC`
- **Community widget duplicates**: added DOM idempotency guard preventing duplicate widgets on repeated news refresh cycles
- **Settings help text**: suppressed raw i18n key paths rendering when translation is missing
- **Intelligence Findings badge**: fixed toggle state and listener lifecycle
- **Context menu styles**: restored intel-findings context menu styles
- **CSS theme variables**: defined missing `--panel-bg` and `--panel-border` variables

## [2.3.8] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Finance variant**: Added a dedicated market-first variant (`finance.worldmonitor.app`) with finance/trading-focused feeds, panels, and map defaults
- **Finance desktop profile**: Added finance-specific desktop config and build profile for Tauri packaging

### Changed

- **Variant feed loading**: `loadNews` now enumerates categories dynamically and stages category fetches with bounded concurrency across variants
- **Feed resilience**: Replaced direct MarketWatch RSS usage in finance/full/tech paths with Google News-backed fallback queries
- **Classification pressure controls**: Tightened AI classification budgets for tech/full and tuned per-feed caps to reduce startup burst pressure
- **Timeline behavior**: Wired timeline filtering consistently across map and news panels
- **AI summarization defaults**: Switched OpenRouter summarization to auto-routed free-tier model selection

### Fixed

- **Finance panel parity**: Kept data-rich panels while adding news panels for finance instead of removing core data surfaces
- **Desktop finance map parity**: Finance variant now runs first-class Deck.GL map/layer behavior on desktop runtime
- **Polymarket fallback**: Added one-time direct connectivity probe and memoized fallback to prevent repeated `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` storms
- **FRED fallback behavior**: Missing `FRED_API_KEY` now returns graceful empty payloads instead of repeated hard 500s
- **Preview CSP tooling**: Allowed `https://vercel.live` script in CSP so Vercel preview feedback injection is not blocked
- **Trending quality**: Suppressed noisy generic finance terms in keyword spike detection
- **Mobile UX**: Hidden desktop download prompt on mobile devices

## [2.3.7] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Full light mode theme**: Complete light/dark theme system with CSS custom properties, ThemeManager module, FOUC prevention, and `getCSSColor()` utility for theme-aware inline styles
- **Theme-aware maps and charts**: Deck.GL basemap, overlay layers, and CountryTimeline charts respond to theme changes in real time
- **Dark/light mode header toggle**: Sun/moon icon in the header bar for quick theme switching, replacing the duplicate UTC clock
- **Desktop update checker**: Architecture-aware download links for macOS (ARM/Intel) and Windows
- **Node.js bundled in Tauri installer**: Sidecar no longer requires system Node.js
- **Markdown linting**: Added markdownlint config and CI workflow

### Changed

- **Panels modal**: Reverted from "Settings" back to "Panels" — removed redundant Appearance section now that header has theme toggle
- **Default panels**: Enabled UCDP Conflict Events, UNHCR Displacement, Climate Anomalies, and Population Exposure panels by default

### Fixed

- **CORS for Tauri desktop**: Fixed CORS issues for desktop app requests
- **Markets panel**: Keep Yahoo-backed data visible when Finnhub API key is skipped
- **Windows UNC paths**: Preserve extended-length path prefix when sanitizing sidecar script path
- **Light mode readability**: Darkened neon semantic colors and overlay backgrounds for light mode contrast

## [2.3.6] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- **Windows console window**: Hide the `node.exe` console window that appeared alongside the desktop app on Windows

## [2.3.5] - 2026-02-16

### Changed

- **Panel error messages**: Differentiated error messages per panel so users see context-specific guidance instead of generic failures
- **Desktop config auto-hide**: Desktop configuration panel automatically hides on web deployments where it is not relevant

## [2.3.4] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- **Windows sidecar crash**: Strip `\\?\` UNC extended-length prefix from paths before passing to Node.js — Tauri `resource_dir()` on Windows returns UNC-prefixed paths that cause `EISDIR: lstat 'C:'` in Node.js module resolution
- **Windows sidecar CWD**: Set explicit `current_dir` on the Node.js Command to prevent bare drive-letter working directory issues from NSIS shortcut launcher
- **Sidecar package scope**: Add `package.json` with `"type": "module"` to sidecar directory, preventing Node.js from walking up the entire directory tree during ESM scope resolution

## [2.3.3] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- **Keychain persistence**: Enable `apple-native` (macOS) and `windows-native` (Windows) features for the `keyring` crate — v3 ships with no default platform backends, so API keys were stored in-memory only and lost on restart
- **Settings key verification**: Soft-pass network errors during API key verification so transient sidecar failures don't block saving
- **Resilient keychain reads**: Use `Promise.allSettled` in `loadDesktopSecrets` so a single key failure doesn't discard all loaded secrets
- **Settings window capabilities**: Add `"settings"` to Tauri capabilities window list for core plugin permissions
- **Input preservation**: Capture unsaved input values before DOM re-render in settings panel

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-15

### Security

- **CORS hardening**: Tighten Vercel preview deployment regex to block origin spoofing (`worldmonitorEVIL.vercel.app`)
- **Sidecar auth bypass**: Move `/api/local-env-update` behind `LOCAL_API_TOKEN` auth check
- **Env key allowlist**: Restrict sidecar env mutations to 18 known secret keys (matching `SUPPORTED_SECRET_KEYS`)
- **postMessage validation**: Add `origin` and `source` checks on incoming messages in LiveNewsPanel
- **postMessage targetOrigin**: Replace wildcard `'*'` with specific embed origin
- **CORS enforcement**: Add `isDisallowedOrigin()` check to 25+ API endpoints that were missing it
- **Custom CORS migration**: Migrate `gdelt-geo` and `eia` from custom CORS to shared `_cors.js` module
- **New CORS coverage**: Add CORS headers + origin check to `firms-fires`, `stock-index`, `youtube/live`
- **YouTube embed origins**: Tighten `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` regex in `youtube/embed.js`
- **CSP hardening**: Remove `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src` in both `index.html` and `tauri.conf.json`
- **iframe sandbox**: Add `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation"` to YouTube embed iframe
- **Meta tag validation**: Validate URL query params with regex allowlist in `parseStoryParams()`

### Fixed
